### Compatibility with other extensions

*Coming soon*

### Limitations

* The extension is deeply tied to the inner workings of [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com), meaning that 
  significant changes on their side could (temporarily) break it. If that happens, you can either:

    * wait for me to fix it (you can
      [open an issue](https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-word-bank-dnd/issues/new) if there is none yet about it),

    * if you're a developer, try to fix it yourself, then
      [open a related PR](https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-word-bank-dnd/compare).

### Roadmap

* Allow to manage different profiles, each of which can be assigned to specific courses.

* Provide an options page based on the options popup.
