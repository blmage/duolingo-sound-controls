### Features

* Allows defining different volume and speed settings for each type of sound:

    * effects

    * normal and slow sentences,

    * normal and slow words,

    * other sounds,

    in different contexts:

    * listening challenges,

    * other challenges,

    * stories,

    * forum discussions,

    * dictionary pages,

    * other contexts.

* Default settings can be defined for each sound type, and reused in each context.

* All settings can be defined relative to the original settings, or override them entirely.

* A main volume setting is available to quickly adjust the volume of all sounds in a context.

### Compatibility

<h4>

  Duolingo TTS Controls
</h4>
All the settings from the <a href="https://www.github.com/blmage/duolingo-tts-controls">Duolingo TTS Controls</a> 
extension take precedence over those from this extension.

#### Other extensions

Out of the box, the extension should be compatible with all others: 
settings that are applied to sounds by other extensions treated in the same way as the original Duo settings.

### Limitations

* The extension is deeply tied to the inner workings of [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com), meaning that 
  significant changes on their side could (temporarily) break it. If that happens, you can either:

    * wait for me to fix it (you can
      [open an issue](https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-sound-controls/issues/new) if there is none yet about it),

    * if you're a developer, try to fix it yourself, then
      [open a related PR](https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-sound-controls/compare).

### Roadmap

* Allow to manage different profiles, each of which can be assigned to specific courses.

* Provide an options page based on the options popup.
